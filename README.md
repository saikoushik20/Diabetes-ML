# Diabetes-ML

The project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to assess the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes. By harnessing historical medical data and relevant features, the model will offer an early evaluation of diabetes risk, facilitating proactive healthcare interventions and personalized treatment strategies.      

 
 ## Libaries       
 1.pandas for data handling.    
2.numpy for numerical computations.    
3.matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.     
4.sklearn for machine learning functions and algorithms.     
5.joblib for model saving/loading.     
6.warnings for handling warnings.   
The two core algorithms RandomForestClassifier and the DecisionTreeClassifier from the sklearn.ensemble and sklearn.tree modules, respectively.
